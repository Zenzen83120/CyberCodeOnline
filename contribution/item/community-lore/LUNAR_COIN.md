In ancient times, it was believed that coins were necessary to ensure a safe travel to enter the realm of the dead. Now, they are treated as nothing more than a waste of material. However, Yen begs to differ.

At the corner of the Shangri-La Market Street, there is a store that accepts golden coins in exchange for food and other commodities. When asked why accept such loss, they only answer in the exact same words: "Our family believes that history always have value."

But of course we'll never know for sure. What value does an obsolete form of currency hold? What does the engraving mean? Who is Yenâ€” or rather who are Yen? and what does she want to do with these coins?
